This was a final project completed for a 4th year fundamentals to computer animation class at the University of Victoria.

Learning Objectives:
1. Create a particle system, considering aspects such as particle lifespan, velocity, and use of efficient data structures.
2. Create first a traditional straight vortex for the snow particles to interact with
3. Create a "curved vortex". For this project this is defined as a vortex that goes about a Bezier spline.

A "Frenet Frame" was computed to allow for the curvature of the snow about any given point on the spline.
