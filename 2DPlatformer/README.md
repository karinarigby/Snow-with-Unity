This is the final capstone project for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Visual Arts at the University of Victoria. The self-directed project was meant to reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the combined degree and incorporate both computer science and visual arts. I took this opportunity to dive into game development for the first time. In this time period my goal was not to create a production-ready product, but to experience firsthand what goes into game development.

### Learning Objectives
Understanding, design, and implementation of the following:
1. Successful game development cycle
2. Overall game design
3. Good level design
4. The relationship between technology and art for the creation of video games
5. The assets required for success in the game design
6. Unity's best practices

### Results
I worked on this project for approximately ninety hours over thirteen weeks. Among other things, that time was spent on:
- researching
- creating all art assets
- preparing the level using Unity Editor tools
- setting up the game to be playable with a ps3 controller
- scripting hazards and character physics and movement
- rigging the 2D character and animating their movements dependant on what state they were in  

As expected, this project is by no means production-ready, but has provided me with a rich learning experience to build upon in my future endeavors.

### Game Premise
Get all the colour back from the world.
